# &Oslash;MQ plugin for RabbitMQ

This RabbitMQ plugin uses the Erlang "Erlzmq" &Oslash; bindings to
bridge &Oslash; and AMQP traffic. Earlier versions used the original
(and now deprecated) Erlzmq bindings, but current versions use the
newer NIF-based Erlzmq2 bindings.

For detailed documentation have a look at the
[project's wiki](http://wiki.github.com/rabbitmq/rmq-0mq/) on the
GitHub.
